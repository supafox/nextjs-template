- "Use semantic HTML elements only (e.g., <button>, <input>, <dialog>) with proper roles and ARIA attributes."
- "Primitives must be unstyled. Do not use Tailwind, inline styles, classNames, or dynamic class generation."
- "Ensure accessibility: ARIA labeling, keyboard interaction, focus visibility, and label association."
- "Implement keyboard support where relevant: Tab, Shift+Tab, Escape, arrow keys, etc."
- "Expose forwardRef with correct typing for all primitives."
- "Accept and forward native HTML props only. Keep API surface minimal."
- "Ensure CSP safety: no scripts, no inline styles, no dynamic injections, no eval or new Function()."
- "Use Framer Motion with static variants and nonce support _only if necessary_. Avoid dynamic motion values."
- "Use Reactâ€™s useId() or similar strategy to generate safe unique IDs. Never hardcode or randomize IDs."
- "Avoid direct DOM manipulation unless required for a11y or control (e.g., focus, measurements)."
- "Never import third-party UI libraries or primitives. All logic must be implemented internally."
- "Keep primitive logic clean, minimal, and decoupled from UI or theming concerns."
