- "Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. Do not use inline styles, global class names, or dynamic <style> tags."
- "Accept standard props like className, children, and appropriate HTML attributes. Avoid style={{}}."
- "Use Framer Motion or Tailwind for animations only if variants are statically defined and nonce-safe."
- "Avoid dynamic style injection or scripts that would violate Content Security Policy (CSP)."
- "If the component includes overlays (modals, popovers), render them in a portal using ReactDOM.createPortal."
- "Only compose from internal primitives or Headless UI. Do not import third-party component libraries like Radix or React Aria."
- "UI components should remain stateless and defer accessibility, keyboard logic, and structure to primitives."
